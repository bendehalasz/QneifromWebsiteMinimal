    <p>This Privacy Notice applies to our use of any and all personal information collected by us for inclusion on the Qneiform Codex (“Platform Personal Data“). If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal by reason its inclusion on the Qneiform Platform, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Notice.</p>

    <h3>What personal information does Qneiform collect and why?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of processing Platform Personal Data is to allow businesses that subscribe to the Qneiform Codex (“Subscribing Organisations”) and their clients to better understand the professional talent landscape and identify high-potential individuals who may be suitable hires for organisations in the space. Doing so allows Subscribing Organisations to contextualise the wider data-set that we hold, thereby facilitating more relevant approaches to the individuals in the space and more well-informed offerings of career opportunities and professional services.</p>

    <p>The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:</p>
    <p>Information that you or one of your company employees provides to us voluntarily Occasionally company employees will provide us with personal data relating to themselves and their company, including names and responsibilities of key personnel, so that the platform can have the most up to date and accurate data possible.[If, as a company employee, you provide personal information to us about other company personnel, you confirm that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes (as set out in this Privacy Notice) for which their information will be processed. There may be circumstances in which we would tell them where we got the information from.]</p>

    <p>Information that we obtain from third-party sources The majority of Platform Personal Data is collected from third party sources, such as official open registers, in-house research and industry data providers. We can provide further information on these sources on request. This data pertains to the individuals involved with high-performing companies across industries (mainly but not exclusively financial services, legal services, and management consulting) in the UK, Europe, and US. The data that we hold on these individuals includes names, qualifications, experience, information relating to employment history, professional skills, and information on diversity. We have checked that the relevant third-party data providers either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us. We do not record or distribute any contact information whatsoever.</p>

    <h3>Who does Qneiform share my personal information with?</h3>
    <p>We disclose Platform Personal Data to the following categories of recipients:</p>
    <p>To our Subscribing Organisations, who process Platform Personal Data in accordance with their selected usage privileges for primarily the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal evaluation in connection with making decisions to include individuals in hiring processes or offer other opportunities to one or more individuals included in the Qneiform Codex.</li>
        <li>Disclosing Platform Personal Data exported from the Platform on a one-to-one basis to selected clients or prospective clients for the purposes of internal evaluation by such clients or prospective clients in connection with making decisions to initiate hiring processes or seek to include certain individuals in hiring processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person; Third party service providers (as permitted by Qneiform in writing from time to time): Accountants, auditors, lawyers and other outside professional advisors; IT systems, support and hosting service providers; document and records management providers; and similar third-party vendors and outsourced service providers assisting Qneiform or a Subscribing Organisation in carrying out business activities.</p>

    <p>To a potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your Platform Personal Data only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</p>

    <h3>Legal basis for processing personal information</h3>
    <p>The legal basis for which we process Platform Personal Data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR – Legitimate Interests. The processing of limited Platform Personal Data is necessary for the effective use of the Qneiform Codex as it enables Subscribing Organisations to identify high-potential individuals in the Qneiform Codex and their relationships to other individuals in the codex. Without being able to do so, the rich talent and ecosystem data we hold in the Qneiform Codex has little context for it to be used in a meaningful and relevant way.</p>


        <p>It’s worth noting that the platform only holds basic information such as names, job titles,
        qualifications, experience, information relating to employment history that are needed to identify
        the relevant individuals and organisations. We are not seeking to infer further information about
        individuals or, for example, build risk profiles.</p>

        <p>There are a number of legitimate interests dependent on the effective use of the Qneiform Codex. In
        particular, the Qneiform Codex leads to a better supported recruitment market by ensuring that
        hiring organisations and recruitment professionals are better informed about the relevant talent
        landscape in which they operate. Featured individuals benefit from more relevant contact from our
        Subscribing Organisations. Such contact can ultimately help to support their professional role by
        leading to greater accessibility of recruitment processes and more relevant and interesting
        approaches. Subscribing Organisations clearly benefit from the Qneiform Codex by being able to
        make better informed decisions in a variety of areas, from making hires and placements to informing
        their HR strategy.</p>
        <p>All Platform Personal Data is of a limited nature, relates to individuals in a professional capacity and
        is otherwise publicly available by virtue of having been made public by the company in which the
        individuals are involved (usually via the company’s website) or by the individual concerned (through
        public social media). Consequently, the proposed use of the personal data is related to the
        individuals’ role within their company and is likely to elicit relevant contact within the reasonable
        expectations of those individuals i.e. from professional organisations offering career opportunities or
        other suitable offerings to the individual or the company that the data subject represents.</p>
        <p>The legitimate interests of Qneiform and our Subscribing Organisations (as indicated above) are not
        overridden by any particular interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects
        included in the Qneiform Codex, particularly taking into consideration the substantial potential
        professional benefits for the data subject, the fact that the processing of the relevant personal
        information is likely to align with the reasonable expectations of the data subject, and the safeguards
        that we put in place, for example:</p>
        <p>Our Data Policy imposes strict requirements on our Subscribing Organisations’ use of data subjects’
        information to ensure that the rights and freedoms of data subjects are protected.</p>
        <p>We do not store of share contact details for data subjects so in no way facilitate unwanted or
        unwarranted contact or interaction.</p>
        <p>We have various other technical and organisational processes in place to reduce any risks to data
        subjects, such as only showing their name and company position as displayed on their company’s
        website or on their own professional social media page.</p>
        <p>Our research team takes reasonable steps to verify Platform Personal Data and to check/update it at
        regular intervals.</p>
        <p>Our Terms dictate that, on cancellation, all Subscribers delete Platform Personal Data exported from
        the Qneiform Codex and requires certain contractual restrictions to be placed on use of any Platform
        Personal Data disclosed to Subscribing Organisations’ clients.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we
        collect and use Platform Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided under
        the “How to contact us” heading below.</p>
        <h3>How does Qneiform keep my personal information secure?</h3>
        <p>Data security is of great importance to Qneiform and to protect your personal information we have
        put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
        Platform Personal Data. For example, where appropriate we use encryption in transit and at rest,
        have strict and secure access controls. Our Terms and Conditions and Data Policy prescribe certain
        practices and procedures to which our Subscribing Organisations must adhere. The measures we use
        are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal
        information.</p>
        <h4>Your data protection rights</h4>
        <p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>
        <p>If you wish to request access to, or correction, updating or deletion of, your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</p>
        <p>In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.

        <p>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

        <p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information, though we would ask that you try to solve any issue with us directly first.</p>
        <p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>


        <h3>International data transfers</h3>
        <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>
        <p>Specifically, our Subscribing Organisations and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
        <p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers of personal information, which require all partners to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.</p>
        <p>The relevant Standard Contractual Clauses can be found here.</p>

        <h3>Data retention</h3>
        <p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. Please note:</p>
        <p>If you sign up for marketing emails from us we retain your personal data until you opt out of receiving such communications using the “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” link provided in such communications. In such circumstances, we retain a suppression file that contains the details necessary to ensure that we continue to respect such opt-out.</p>
        <p>If you register for a demo and do not subsequently subscribe to the Qneiform Codex on behalf of your organization, we retain your details for 24 months after any interaction.</p>
        <p>Details of an individual’s involvement with a company on the platform will remain visible for the duration that it is in the public domain.</p>
        <p>Your information may be retained for longer, for example, to provide you or your organisation with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements. It may also be retained for shorter periods if required to do so by applicable law. When we have no ongoing business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
